2023/04/12
This project analyzes historical rainfall data from Victoria and Gonzales weather stations provided by the Government of Canada (https://climate.weather.gc.ca/historical_data/search_historic_data_e.html) and analyzes it to plot the maximum monthly rainfall and maximum rainfall over a 2-day period for each year from 1995 to 2023. It also calculates the number of days per year with heavy rain and finds the top ten monthly rainfall amounts for each of the two categories. The main purpose of this codeis to provide insights into the historical rainfall patterns in the area and identify trends or anomalies in the data.
