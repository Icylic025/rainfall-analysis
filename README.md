2023/04/12

The purpose of this project is to exercise gathering, cleaning, and analyzing data, and also in using a third party [plotting package](https://ptolemy.berkeley.edu/java/ptplot5.10/ptolemy/plot/doc/index.htm).

This project analyzes [historical rainfall data](https://climate.weather.gc.ca/historical_data/search_historic_data_e.html) from Victoria and Gonzales weather stations provided by the Government of Canada and analyzes it to plot the maximum monthly rainfall and maximum rainfall over a 2-day period for each year from 1995 to 2023. It also calculates the number of days per year with heavy rain and finds the top ten monthly rainfall amounts for each of the two categories. It is created to provide insights into the historical rainfall patterns in the area and identify trends or anomalies in the data.
